## Security oriented folks 🤓☝️
* ASS is akschoully built with pure .NET and WPF, relying only on your own installation of FFMPEG, a trusted industry-standard tool. 
* ASS is fully **open-source** : no hidden surprises, no shady dependencies.
* Does not require elevated permissions to run.
* Still not sure? Review the code, modify it, or compile it yourself.

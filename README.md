## Security oriented folks 🤓☝️
* ASS is akschoully built with pure .NET and WPF, relying only on your own installation of FFMPEG, a trusted industry-standard tool.
* Yes, Microsoft SmartScreen will throw a warning. It's perfectly normal, since I won't be paying hundreds of dollars for a code signing certificate.
* ASS is fully **open-source** : no [backdoors](https://storage.googleapis.com/adg-default-storage/Other/iau72yug97d91.webp) 😏, hidden surprises, no shady dependencies.
* Does not require elevated permissions to run.
* Still not sure? Review the code, modify it, or compile it yourself. Be a "smart ASS user!"🧐
